## Task 1
Write a console application that accepts a string and outputs to the string a decision for each word of the string, whether it is a palindrome. Ignore letter case and hyphens.

## Task 2
Write code that swaps the first and last values in the array, the second and penultimate values, and so on. Example: (10, 5, 3, 4) => (4, 3, 5, 10). Array input and output can be done from the console.

## Task 3
Write a code that inserts the value of zero to the elements on the left side of the main diagonal into an array-matrix of arbitrary size, and a value of one to the right. The initial matrix should be declared and filled in the code. Write the result to another variable - an array of the same size as the original one, without modifying the original one.

## Task 4
Implement a Game of Life. 
About the game:
https://playgameoflife.com/
Example on how it works:
https://playgameoflife.com/
The initial state of the field is simply set by a variable - a two-dimensional array (the size of the array determines the size of the playing field).
For each pressing of any button - output to the console in the same format the new state of the field for the next generation.
If the field is empty - display the message "Game over"
If the field does not change during the generation - display the message "Game over"
